<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="_7835886a-ebbc-0aa4-2c5f-95e2f7e04323">The second formal event of The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium took place on 1-3 June, 2005, hosted by Duke University Durham, North Carolina. The event was attended by representatives of seventeen Consortium members. The Roundtable event consisted of two days of Technical Committee meetings, and an all-hands plenary meeting of the membership and attendees. The first two days, a CalConnect Interoperability Eventt was held in parallel with the Technical Committee meetings. The Technical Committee sessions were organized sequentially, to allow all attendees who wished to be involved in the discussions of a Technical Committee the opportunity to do so, and there was definitely “drift” between TC sessions and those participating in the CalConnect Interoperability Event.</p>

<title>Technical Committees</title>
<p id="_68e958f2-4e48-2256-4455-ec5b4d48f69d">All CalConnect Technical Committees met during the course of the Roundtable to review their status and work to date with the entire set of attendees and to progress their work with the large input from the Roundtable. Of particular note:</p>

<p id="_e7f30d83-2520-5beb-f3f5-2e5f93d2baa4">TC-CALDAV has made its CalDAV test script available on the Consortium website (under “Resources”).</p>

<p id="_a655368b-62a2-5c97-527f-0c596a5f939d">TC-CALSIFY has been re-chartered more explicitly as a coordination effort between Consortium Technical Committees and the incipient IETF CALISFY working group. The intent is to feed information to the working group as rapidly as possible and ensure that TC work being done for consumption by the working group meets the needs of the WG.</p>

<p id="_2a227441-2c61-fea1-330a-1e24131aeae3">TC-EVENTPUB is developing a survey on Event Publication, which will be distributed as widely as possible, and may require some level of publicity to draw attention to it.</p>

<p id="_46f763bd-bc49-2e84-ce0a-b458d31ab0e7">TC-IOPTEST has taken on the tasks associate with the former TC-MIN-IOP to determine the “minimum interoperability subset” for iCalendar. This is in addition to TC-IOPTEST’s charter to plan for, develop and formalize the Consortium’s CalConnect Interoperability Event testing.</p>

<p id="_57075e93-e09a-27e5-54a6-906dc5f43363">TC-RECURR is planning a second questionnaire to delve more deeply into some specific recurrence issues identified by the first questionnaire.
