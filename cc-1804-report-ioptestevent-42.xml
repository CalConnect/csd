<title>Report</title>
<p id="_0835cc79-2d5d-0857-ea9f-ca2a9c7ba8ab">The event was hosted by Jorte in Tokyo, Japan, June 4-8, 2018</p>

<p id="_5fb9ad5c-3836-f649-f082-75e5c7b209ad">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>

<ul id="_ef298344-4424-e3e4-d702-3581628f254a"><li><p id="_3d3abceb-2717-f56e-277d-d4702784ac37">Spherical Cow Group</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_168464d7-978c-9dff-97ac-34bc39be92d9">FastMail</p>
</li>
<li><p id="_b394198a-8d5a-6797-54f9-b425aae8e641">Open-Xchange</p>

</li>
<li><p id="_9c17b203-2ede-4e64-d69f-ec5937fc528c">Jorte</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p id="_4632b8e8-532f-fd9c-68a5-9584dc349f74">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>

<p id="_4c2afd75-b2ae-3060-43a7-5bac3441d533">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>

<p id="_fac57a5e-9964-ed18-9d7e-1064ba924bb7">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>

<p id="_a038b34c-cadc-169e-16d7-39ef8a70ec72">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to  <tt>POST</tt> subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>

<p id="_1618c565-9665-fcef-a5a8-c4242b06f6fa">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>

<p id="_f93088d0-019e-467a-a981-0cfac314c4e0">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p>
