organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_5c1caa58-6d60-46b5-be6e-75ea9f42016d">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international   
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<p id="_4f3d3cdb-e576-4b15-b318-27221481504b">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_22e8b9a8-f10b-4517-9a08-8641c0264076">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_f474b21b-02a8-4bac-93a5-cf1990129f52">Spherical Cow Group</p>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_50426bb5-4195-497f-bbc0-9f14770d199a">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_875cefb0-ee07-4acb-bc68-72483094c7fe">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_c6a3dfc1-27e3-4700-9779-8a630a83eaf4">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_c30c2ec6-3b79-4c3b-b4c2-746ff56a0110">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_e5355db4-e9f0-4a01-b8be-2a27b82c2411">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_90b93c71-5b0a-43fa-9037-0bb3e3e87d8c">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
