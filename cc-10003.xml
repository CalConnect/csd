international legal situation of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p id="_531a1a5d-582d-4709-9ce4-c4b01d357e98">CalConnect deliverables are non-binding — their objective is to ensure
compatibility of technologies and systems on a worldwide basis.</p>
<p id="_89462354-8663-4735-85c0-9fe2b374fdf2">To ensure the applicability and accessibility of CalConnect
deliverables, the implementation and continued usage of content within
the deliverables must be possible to the worldwide audience without
discrimination, including any patent embodiment in such deliverables.</p></clause></introduction></preface><sections>
