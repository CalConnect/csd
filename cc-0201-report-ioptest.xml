<title>The Not-so-good News</title>
<p id="_be755b78-771d-a008-1a81-9a3398100ed6">The testing done was more at an vendor to vendor level than a pure IETF “RFC Conformance” test (where we test the explicit  <tt>MUST</tt>/<tt>SHOULD</tt>/<tt>MAY</tt>/etc. requirements). We need to find a way to identify all of the IETF requirements and map them to vendor to vendor tests that we generally do (or provide some matrix of what we must test to satisfy the IETF requirements for an interop event).</p>

We misconverted it to be a single instance meeting that repeated at the original date/time (which was before the actual instance date/time so that’s not so good).</p>

<p id="_cf208241-9cff-c19c-c867-923ebf1052d2">Vendor1 had some small issues with adhering to the RFCs. Guenter was very active in either fixing or explaining them. For example, Vendor1 sends back ALL invitees on a  <tt>REFRESH</tt> request but RFC 2446 expressly states that only the requestors  <tt>ATTENDEE</tt> info is allowed. As a result, we incorrectly identify the “Request for Update” as being from the 1st listed <tt>ATTENDEE</tt> rather than from the actual requestor.</p>

While they do support the basic accept, decline and tentative acceptances, the other iTIP messages are ignored or not supported so trying them against an invitation from VENDOR2 results in an undetermined state or loss of workflow (at least from the non-VENDOR2 POV). We did not receive any Vendor2 originating workflow, they simply responded to the ones we sent out. As such, we do not know how well we interoperate with them when they are the Organizer of an event or repeating event. I was not able to find out if this was because we did not have enough testing time or if they are unable to originate iCalendar workflow just yet</p>

This should  <tt>NOT</tt> be a repeat issue but since its come up again we need to draft some guidelines for the ‘proper’ multipart bundling of iCalendar above and beyond the flat ASCII messages.</p>

<p id="_8ee8bdd8-af19-7569-ad4b-f474d9bcd5ce">By the next event we plan to have a formalized testing matrix and plan that we can all use to do interop testing. There needs to be some kind of mapping between what the IETF is looking for relating to standards acceptance and what we implementors are looking for such as feature C workflow level interop.</p>

<p id="_47b7ff8b-3600-8b33-e902-6efae41955cb">I’m working on making an understandable matrix of the <tt>MUST</tt>/<tt>SHOULD</tt>/<tt>MAY</tt>/etc. clauses in the RFCs and what they mean for testing. Given our pending release schedules I did not have time to complete this lately. Hopefully I can get it done after some hard earned time off and before we spin up again.</p>
