<p id="_b7406002-3d0f-48da-818f-3d3eecf925fa">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_e2bcbbf7-1c45-446d-b675-9d5d526d8e5f">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_22fb98c2-652f-4333-8b0c-3229926ca4ac">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_4d669f78-99cc-4744-98ad-b9e6b6e1e5fa">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_aeee1215-cbab-47fd-bc29-c88ba5805ec0">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_5902c810-3bc4-4ce0-aadd-ce4be6d29c44">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_22b5bf34-015f-434e-bb18-b9c2b040a590">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_8c245fce-6cd4-43c2-9211-6a56b1051df7">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_9b2186c5-4a89-4415-a0e0-13a15181730c">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_87a13476-a737-45ec-9fdb-6a6abb798445">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_1dbbc5cf-50ca-47b4-8330-b220b0aaca4a">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_cd1af01d-e8ad-46c9-9c90-72ff38746af3">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
